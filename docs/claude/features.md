## The landing page (`#screen-landing`, index.html)
The public front door, and the only screen most visitors ever see. Order: nav →
under-construction banner → hero → measured stats strip → **How we teach** →
subjects → what we offer → Game Zone → three ways in → free-while-we-build panel
→ 3 steps → tutors → footer.
- ⚠ **PRICING IS HIDDEN, NOT DELETED.** The three priced tiers at `#plans` were
  replaced by an "everything is free right now" panel; the nav Pricing link and
  `#pd-upgrade-btn` are gone/hidden. `modal-plans`, `Store.listPlans()`,
  `purchase_*()` and the admin Plans tab all still work — restoring it is markup.
  `#plans` is kept as the section id so old anchors still land somewhere sensible.
- ⚠ **"How we teach" is the product's actual claim**, not decoration: many simple
  questions covering the WHOLE syllabus beat a handful of very hard ones;
  difficulty rises Basic → Medium → Hard → Word Problems where harder means
  *applied*, never obscure. It is why the subsection split and the 4-level scale
  exist at all.
- ⚠ **Every number on this page is measured and goes stale silently.** The stats
  strip carries a comment saying how to re-count. (The page claimed "five learning
  games" in three places for two days after the seventh shipped.)
- ⚠ Under 640px every `[data-carousel]` grid becomes a horizontal scroll-snap
  track with dots — **an overflow detector that does not stop at a scrolling
  ancestor reports every card as protruding**; they are off-screen by design.
- ⚠ Contrast here was the worst in the app (footer disclaimer at 1.65:1). The
  colour is usually on an **ANCESTOR** (the `<footer>`, not the `<p>`), and every
  card is translucent white over a gradient with no opaque background anywhere —
  a naive probe reads `rgba(255,255,255,.05)` as the ground and reports 1:1.
  Composite the layers over each gradient stop and take the worst.
- Carousel dots are 16×44px via `padding` + `background-clip: content-box` (+
  explicit `box-sizing: content-box`, or Tailwind preflight eats the padding).

## The Game Zone (minigames)
`engine/minigame.js`, reached from `#dash-games-tile` / `#screen-minigames`. Seven
live games: **Who Wants to Be a Billionaire?** 💰 (20-rung prize ladder; Q1–10 the
child's grade easy→medium, Q11–15 hardest textbook, **Q16–20 general knowledge**
from `minigame_gk.js`; 4 lifelines, safe havens at 5/10/15; synthesised WebAudio —
**no audio files, no copyright** — and a distinct name and look on purpose, no show
logo/music/wording) · **Quick Fire** ⚡ (60s blitz, combo ×1–5) · **Word Builder**
🧩 (`minigame_words.js`; ⚠ a clue must never contain its own word, and words are
A–Z only because the tiles are letters) · **Island Explorer** 🗺️
(`minigame_geo.js`; ⚠ every fact real and verifiable; two wrongs and the tour
**continues** — a child always finishes the trip) · **Number Ninja** 🥷 (7 belts ×
5 sums, **GENERATED** per belt, never drawn from the bank) · **Brain Battle** ⚔️
(pass-the-phone; both players drawn from the **same difficulty band** but never the
same question — the second would inherit the answer — and a resume always lands on
the handover, never mid-question) · **Time Traveller** 🕰️ (`minigame_time.js`;
⚠ a label must never contain a 3+ digit number, and never two same-year events in
one round, whose order would be unknowable).
- ⚠ **Game answers NEVER call `recordAnswer()` / `_recordDaily()`.** A replay must
  not distort the mastery, mistake and daily reporting parents rely on. Bests live
  in `DB.games.*` (seeded in `Store._defaultStudent`, so existing children backfill
  for free). In-progress games persist to sessionStorage per student.
- The hub's four `mg-card-soon` teasers each have a **full design-intent comment
  block above `renderHub()`** — read it before building one.
- ⚠ **Confetti is `launchConfetti(count)` (app.js), NOT the canvas-confetti
  `confetti({...})` API** — that library is not loaded, and a `typeof` guard made
  every burst silently no-op.
- **Ask the Crowd** — `minigame_polls` + three RPCs (granted `anon, authenticated`);
  the child shares `/v/<CODE>` (`vote.html`, standalone like `guest.html`).
  ⚠ **The CORRECT ANSWER IS NEVER STORED** — the row holds question + options only.
  The table FKs `students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- **Score sharing** — `navigator.share`, preferring a canvas-rendered 1080×1080 PNG
  where `navigator.canShare({files})` allows, else intent links or clipboard;
  `score.html?s=&c=&a=`. ⚠ **A share carries a score and a challenge — never the
  child's name, id, or any profile link.**
- **Gates**: `DB.restrictions.minigamesDisabled` (parent toggle;
  `MiniGames.syncTile()` hides the tile live) and `_PLAN_GATED_SCREENS.minigames`.
  An excluded games tile **hides rather than teasing** the child.
- Tests: `test-minigame-arcade.js`, `test-number-ninja.js`, `test-brain-battle.js`,
  `test-time-traveller.js`.

## Parent-controlled Game Settings
`engine/game_settings.js` (`GameSettings`, loaded **before** `minigame.js`). Per
child, in `DB.restrictions.games` → `students.settings`, parent-written through
`Auth.saveGameSettings` with the same rollback-on-refusal as every Controls toggle
(**no migration** — RLS on `students` already gives a child SELECT only, proven
live and rolled back). Missing/partial settings `normalise()` to: Balanced · all
grade subjects · Medium · 10 per round · weak focus off · avoid-recent on · GK off.
- **`GameSettings.GAMES` is the single capability table** (`supportsSubjectMix /
  Difficulty / RoundLength / WeakTopics / GeneralKnowledge / RecentAvoidance`).
  **Never branch on a game's name.**
- **Every quiz game draws through `pickForGame()`**: valid MCQs only (`isValidMCQ`
  — answer present once, options unique, answer within the first four), the child's
  grade only (others only with `crossGradePractice`, and last), locked/admin-blocked
  chapters out, excluded subjects removed **before** anything else,
  largest-remainder shares (40/30/30 → 4/3/3) spread through the round rather than
  clumped, levels never above `min(difficulty top, restrictions.maxDifficulty)`,
  weak-area weights from `DB.chapters`, recent ids (`DB.games.recent`, cap 150)
  avoided while fresh ones remain, shortfall filled from another **included**
  subject with a `console.warn`. Zero usable ⇒ `NO_QUESTIONS_MSG`, distinct from
  "still loading". A game with a `levels` ladder keeps the exact level before
  freshness (Brain Battle pairs must match); a free-running game prefers fresh.
- Adaptive: `DB.games.adaptive {level,up,down}` — +1 after 3 right, −1 after 2
  wrong, clamped to the cap at read AND write. Recorded by Billionaire and Quick
  Fire, never by Brain Battle (two players).
- ⚠ GK defaults OFF, so Billionaire's rungs 16–20 are textbook level-4 unless the
  parent turns it on; hub copy and tier badge follow the setting.
- ⚠ The parent card renders by `innerHTML` **inside the chalkboard `#screen-parent`**,
  which is dark in BOTH themes — `.gs-*` carries a `#screen-parent` override block.
  `test-game-settings-ui.js` (19 text styles ≥ 4.5:1 in both themes at 360px, plus
  overflow and touch sizes), `test-game-settings.js`.

## Teacher Mode — Hybrid Classroom Command Centre
Main navigation is **Home · Classrooms · Set Work · Results** plus a labelled
`⋯ More` (Materials, Messages, Gradebook, Archived work, Teacher settings). The
classroom screen is **Overview · Work · Pupils** plus `⋯ More` (Materials, Results,
Settings). Set Work: classroom → sharing choice → grade/subject → chapter → number
of questions → due date; everything else inside `<details id="ta-more-options">`.
Full write-up in ENGINEERING-NOTES.
- **Location survives refresh**: `psac_teacher_loc_v1` (owner-scoped) holds tab,
  list filter, selected results and the open classroom + section.
- **Evidence thresholds** live in `TeacherInsights`: ≥ 5 answers before "may need
  help" (< 50%), ≥ 3 answers in a chapter before naming it, "very quickly" = < 8 s
  /question **and** < 60%. **Never label on one or two answers.**
- ⚠ **The board's `p:not(…):not(…)` rule scores (1,3,1)** and beats every single-id
  override; the command-centre CSS uses `#screen-teacher#screen-teacher` on purpose.
  Paper cards carry their own ink in both themes.
- ⚠ **A refresh superseded by a newer one resolves `undefined`** —
  `TeacherWorkspace.ensureLoaded()` waits for the newest in-flight refresh and
  judges by `loaded`, or Home shows its error state on every load.
- Sharing choice is on step 1 on purpose (online groups need "Anyone with the link"
  without discovering a disclosure); PIN is the default whenever the classroom has
  pupils, flipped only by the teacher's own tap.
- Not shown, on purpose: a "Scheduled" filter (nothing schedules a start), hints /
  attempt limits / answer visibility (no server support). The `?classroom=` share
  link is **inert** (nothing parses it) and is not promoted.
- Tests: `test-teacher-command-centre.js` (VM), `-layout.js` (360/1280 ×
  light/dark, overflow + contrast + 44px targets; `--shots DIR`).

## Child-facing vs parent-facing, deliberately
- The child's activity recap is **unfiltered** — the parent's `_filters` live in
  localStorage per browser and on a shared phone would silently blank the child's
  own record of their work.
- **There is no "missed sessions" list on a child's screen, and must not be.** On
  a parent's calendar an unticked row is information; on a child's it is a list of
  their failures served every time they open the app.
- Family overview is **ordered by who has been quietest, never by score** —
  ranking siblings is the wrong thing to hand a parent, and accuracy is not
  comparable across grades.
- A chapter with no attempts is reported as **not started**, never 0%.
- ⚠ Report copy says **"they"**, not "she". Nothing records a child's gender.
- The chapter card says **"correct"**, never "mastery" — `getChapterPct()` is
  accuracy, so 2/2 once read as "100% mastery ★★★". `_chapterProgress()` is the
  single reading used by both card and tiles; `attempted` counts **answers given**,
  not distinct questions seen, so the card never claims "12 of 19 done". ⚠ An
  unknown pool (`total === 0`, grid painted before QuestionLoader answered) must
  **withhold** the mastery claim, not assume it.
- The daily goal deliberately does **not** drive the streak — breaking a 12-day
  streak because a nine-year-old managed three questions is a punishment no
  child-facing app should hand out. `daily[key].g` latches the celebration once
  per day.
- Reports and the digest use **rolling 7-day windows, not calendar weeks** (on a
  Monday a calendar week holds one day), and a previous window of zero renders
  "new", never +100%. **"No dated history" means unknown, never idle** — that
  distinction is the difference between an accurate digest and telling every
  parent their child has stopped working.
- Derived activity rows are **never written into `schedule_entries`** — that table
  is parent-editable, and storing actuals there would let a parent delete the
  record that a mock exam happened.
- A parent's own settings apply to children by **merge, never replace** —
  `lockedChapters` is per-child and must survive the write.
