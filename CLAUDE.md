# PSAC Exam Practice — Project Brief for Claude

## What this is
A vanilla JS single-page app (SPA) for Shanvi (child of deepmala.gobin@accenture.com) to revise for the Mauritius PSAC primary school exam. Grades 4, 5, 6. Subjects: Maths, English, French, Science, History & Geography.

Hosted on **Netlify**. Backend: **Supabase**. No frameworks — pure HTML/CSS/JS + Tailwind CDN.

---

## Tech stack
- `index.html` — single HTML file, all screens inside, shown/hidden via `showScreen(id)`
- `style.css` — custom CSS (Tailwind extended)
- `engine/` — all JS logic (loaded via `<script>` tags at bottom of index.html)
- `subjects/[grade-subject]/` — each subject has `_manifest.js` + `questions/` folder
- `netlify/functions/` — Netlify serverless functions (Node.js, esbuild bundler)
- `sw.js` — PWA service worker (cache-first shell, SWR for questions, network-first for API)
- `manifest.json` — PWA manifest
- Supabase URL: `https://xawvjwsiqhtxgpocdqgm.supabase.co`

## Engine load order (index.html script tags)
```
supabase.js → store.js → registry.js → questions_engine.js → helpers.js →
events.js → protect.js → question_loader.js → auth.js → admin.js →
teacher.js → forum.js → calendar.js → app.js
```
Then all `_manifest.js` files (grades 4/5/6, all subjects).

---

## Key globals
- `STATIC_QUESTIONS` — flat array, all question objects pushed here by question files
- `CHAPTERS` — flat array of chapter objects from active subject pack
- `ACTIVE_PACK` — current subject pack object
- `ACTIVE_STUDENT_ID` — current student's UUID
- `DB` — student progress/stats object (saved to Supabase + localStorage)
- `S` — in-memory session state: `S.practice.{chapterId, qs, idx, difficulty}`, `S.exam.{qs, answers, flagged, idx, type, endTime}`
- `SUBJECT_PACKS` — all registered subject packs

## Key functions
- `makeMCQ({id, chapterId, difficulty, question, options, answer, hint, explanation})` — question factory
- `startChapterDirect(chapterId, forceDiff)` — starts practice for a chapter
- `loadPracticeQuestion()` — renders current practice question
- `renderExamQuestion()` — renders current exam question
- `renderChapterSelect()` — renders chapter grid (splits regular vs enrichment)
- `assembleExamPaper(type)` — builds exam from chapters weighted by examWeight
- `showScreen(id)` — navigate between screens
- `_makeImgsZoomable(container)` — makes `<img>` AND `<svg>` elements zoomable via lightbox
- `openLightbox(src)` / `closeLightbox()` — lightbox for image zoom
- `speakQuestion(mode)` — text-to-speech for 'practice' or 'exam'
- `shareResult()` — Web Share API on exam results
- `setupPushNotifications(studentId)` — registers push subscription
- `_saveResume()` / `_doResume()` — session resume after page refresh

---

## Question file pattern
```js
'use strict';
STATIC_QUESTIONS.push(
  makeMCQ({ id:'g5sc-XXX', chapterId:'plants', difficulty:2,
    question:'Question text (innerHTML, so <b> and <img> tags work)',
    options:['A','B','C','D'], answer:'B',
    hint:'...', explanation:'...' })
);
```
- IDs: `[grade-abbrev][subject-abbrev]-[chapter-abbrev]-[3-digit-number]`
- difficulty: 1=Basic, 2=Medium, 3=Hard, 4=Challenge (word problems)
- Images: use `<img src="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Filename.jpg" style="max-height:220px;border-radius:8px">` — alt text must NEVER be the answer
- Inline SVG maps: embed directly in question string, click-to-zoom works automatically

## Enrichment chapters pattern
```js
// In _manifest.js:
{ id: 'g5enr-personalities', name: 'Key Historical Personalities', icon: '👤',
  enrichment: true, examWeight: 2,
  enrichmentNote: 'Derived from syllabus, NOT a direct MIE chapter.' }
```
- Marked `enrichment: true` so they get gold "✨ BONUS" badge in UI
- `examWeight: 2` means they appear in exams (0 = excluded)
- Guard comment in question files: `// @enrichment — DO NOT remove during syllabus audits`

## question_loader.js — LOCAL_FILES
For `file://` local dev, each subject has an explicit file list in `LOCAL_FILES`. When adding new question files, add them here too. Prod (Netlify) auto-discovers all files in `subjects/[id]/questions/`.

---

## Subjects & chapters completed
All 15 subjects (grades 4/5/6 × 5 subjects each) are fully built with 19 questions per chapter.

### Enrichment chapters added (examWeight: 2):

- **Grade 6 Science**: Ecosystems in Pictures (+ photo Qs), Our Solar System (+ photo Qs)

### Illustrated questions added to regular chapters:

## Features built (this session)

### Bug fixes
- Cross-subject question contamination fixed (`startChapterDirect` now waits for QuestionLoader)
- `grade5-science` LOCAL_FILES cleaned (removed deleted ch01/ch07/ch08 that no longer exist)
- Circular French question fixed (g5fr-voc-002)

### UI/UX
- Single logout button in header (all modes)
- Admin Content tab reorganised by grade
- Image/SVG lightbox zoom (click any image or inline SVG to expand)
- Enrichment chapters: gold gradient cards with ✨ BONUS badge
- Chapter select splits regular vs enrichment sections

### Session resume
- Auto-saves practice/exam state to `localStorage` on every question render
- Blue "Resume where you left off" banner on dashboard after accidental refresh
- Exam: fully restores questions, answers, flagged, remaining time
- Practice: returns to same chapter
- Clears on normal completion/submission/back button

### Account sharing prevention
- Every fresh student PIN login bumps `session_version` in Supabase DB
- Background guard polls every 5 minutes; also fires immediately on `online` event
- If version mismatch detected → auto-logout with "account accessed on another device" message
- `pdSwitchStudent` (parent view) passes `bumpSession: false` — does NOT kick student

### PWA
- `manifest.json`, `sw.js` (service worker), `icons/icon.svg`, `icons/icon-192.png`, `icons/icon-512.png`
- Install button (`#pwa-install-btn`) in header — shows only when `beforeinstallprompt` fires (Android)
- iOS tip banner — fixed bottom bar on first visit, dismissed to localStorage, never shows if standalone

### Mobile features
- **Haptic feedback**: vibrate on correct (50ms), wrong (double-buzz), level-up (triple)
- **Screen wake lock**: prevents screen sleep during exam, releases on submit
- **Portrait lock**: locks orientation during exam, releases on submit
- **Text-to-speech**: 🔊 button on every question (practice + exam), tap again to stop
- **Share result**: 📤 button on exam results screen, uses Web Share API, falls back to clipboard

### Push notifications
- VAPID keys generated and stored (add to Netlify env vars — see below)
- `netlify/functions/push-subscribe.js` — saves subscription + reminder_time
- `netlify/functions/push-send.js` — sends push to student(s)
- `netlify/functions/push-reminders.js` — cron every 15 min, sends due reminders
- `sw.js` — handles `push` event + `notificationclick`
- Parent dashboard → Controls tab → "🔔 Daily Study Reminder" time picker
- Reminder stored in `push_subscriptions.reminder_time` as "HH:MM" in Mauritius time (UTC+4)
- `package.json` created with `web-push` dependency

## Pending / Not yet done
1. **Supabase table** — must run `supabase-push-table.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (one-time)
2. **Netlify env vars** — must add to Netlify dashboard:
   ```
   VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY  = BExWCMEBx-MGkPCv6tm0nC-DebalPys64ivbkWnWN7pxZuHQqUNtuZ85HehLssxBddlvjGB1d99IgtALRFZo8kc
   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY = KdiUP6MFrJOI_KoXhXRvGOaP_ZasHicqMoJ7e9M0clY
   VAPID_EMAIL       = mailto:deepmala.gobin@accenture.com
   ```
3. **Push notifications for assignments** — infrastructure is ready; wire up `push-send.js` when parent creates an assignment
4. **Badge API** — show assignment count badge on app icon (needs Supabase assignment count)
5. **Enrichment chapters for French/English/Maths** — photo-based vocab (Vocabulaire en Images, Vocabulary Builder, Shapes Around Us)
6. **Grade 6 maths enrichment** — not started
7. **Illustrated questions for Maths chapters** — shapes, graphs, geometry diagrams

## Coding rules (do not break these)
- **Vanilla JS only** — no React, no Vue, no bundlers on the frontend
- **No comments** unless the WHY is non-obvious
- **Autonomous execution** — implement fully without asking for confirmation on obvious tasks
- **Student-first UX** — any new UI must work cleanly on mobile
- **L4 = word problems** — difficulty 4 questions must be applied/contextual, not just harder recall
- **Question images**: alt text must NEVER reveal the answer; always use generic alt ("an object", "a diagram")
- **Enrichment guard**: never remove `// @enrichment` comment blocks from question files

## How to continue
After restart, open this file and tell Claude: "Continue the PSAC project — read CLAUDE.md first."
The immediate next steps are listed under "Pending / Not yet done" above.
